# FEC-data-mining
Using data from the Federal Election Commission, I analyized the amount and the location of campaign donations coming in for both the republican and democratic parties. 

The web mining was done with beautiful soup, and the analysis was done in python. 

I found out that after the supreme court case, FEC v. Citizens United, the dollar amount of the total campaign donations given out jumped tenfold.
